# extremewildfire
NCL and matlab code for the analysis of the extreme wildfires.

This code uses satellite retrievals on daily burned areas to identify the synoptic-scale variation of wildfires in one specific fire-prone region and then analyze the temporal variation of key meteorological parameters derived from ERA5 reanalysis data.
The scripts include the preprocessing steps and the analysis of the drivers, as shown in the workflow below. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the code, please share them with us.
